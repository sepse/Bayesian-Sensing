## 🌟 Overview

Bayesian Sensing is an open-source framework for transforming raw sensor data into meaningful, actionable intelligence in smart buildings. By leveraging Bayesian probability models, this project enables smart building systems to move beyond simple threshold-based triggers toward nuanced contextual awareness.

The framework is built on Home Assistant but can be adapted for other platforms. It demonstrates how multiple data streams from diverse sensors can be combined to infer complex states that no single sensor could detect alone.

## 🧩 Core Principles

- **🔍 Beyond Simple Triggers**: Fuse data to understand context and nuance, not just cross thresholds
- **📊 Handling Uncertainty**: Combine multiple weak or noisy signals into confident inferences
- **🔮 Inferring the Unmeasurable**: Create "virtual sensors" for complex states that have no direct physical sensor
- **⚡ Actionable Insights**: Enable smarter environmental controls, proactive maintenance, and higher-confidence alerts

## 📡 Sensor Coverage

This repository contains examples utilizing:

- 🏃‍♂️ Motion sensors
- 💡 Light intensity sensors
- 📳 Seismic sensors
- 🔊 Sound sensors
- 🌬️ Air quality sensors (CO2, NOx, PM2.5, PM10, PM25, VOC)
- 📱 WiFi device presence
- 🌐 External API data (weather, urban data)

## 🧪 Example Implementations

### 1. 🏠 Enhanced Occupancy Detection

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: bayesian
    name: "Advanced Occupancy Detector"
    probability_threshold: 0.75
    prior: 0.5
    observations:
      # Multiple observation points defined here
```

Combines motion, CO2 levels, sound detection, and WiFi presence to create a robust occupancy detector that understands context and handles sensor limitations.

### 2. 🎯 Activity Classification

Differentiates between types of activities (cooking, sleeping, working) based on environmental signatures and temporal patterns.

### 3. 🌫️ Environmental Quality Predictor

Forecasts indoor air quality deterioration before it occurs, enabling proactive ventilation.

### 4. 🔧 Maintenance Need Detector

Identifies potential equipment issues by recognizing unusual patterns across multiple sensors.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- 🏡 Home Assistant instance
- 📡 Basic sensor array (motion, environmental)
- 📝 Understanding of YAML configuration

### Installation

1. 📥 Clone this repository
2. 📋 Copy the example configurations to your Home Assistant configuration directory
3. 🔄 Adapt entity IDs to match your sensor setup
4. 🔄 Restart Home Assistant
5. ⚙️ Fine-tune probability values based on your environment

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

Bayesian sensors in Home Assistant follow this basic structure:

```yaml
binary_sensor:
  - platform: bayesian
    name: "Sensor Name"
    probability_threshold: 0.5  # Confidence threshold for triggering
    prior: 0.5  # Initial probability assumption
    observations:
      - entity_id: sensor.example
        prob_given_true: 0.8  # Probability of this observation if state is true
        prob_given_false: 0.1  # Probability of this observation if state is false
        platform: 'state'
        to_state: 'on'  # Or other relevant state
```

## 📚 Theory and Background

Bayesian sensors use Bayes' theorem to update the probability of a hypothesis based on evidence. This allows them to:

1. Start with a prior probability
2. Update this probability as new evidence arrives
3. Account for the reliability and relevance of each evidence source
4. Produce a posterior probability representing confidence in the hypothesis
